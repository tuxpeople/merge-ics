## About
This script will get all .ics files (iCalendar files, as specified in the RFC 2445 specification, a.k.a ical), read it and aggregate all events to a new .ics file. If one of the sourcefiles is not readable (or is not RFC 2445 compatible), it will be ignored.

Please note, that this script currently only supports the VEVENT-tag. Nothing else (this means: no todo's etc...).

Before using this script, please take a look into its header. There are some useful informations.

More documentations is comming later (probably)...
